        <h3>Choose the Correct Wire to Cut and Enter the Correct Password</h3>
        <p>Hint: All the rules and puzzle are in the room. There are seven rules for cutting wires and seven puzzles for password</p>

        <p>password is following the rules: 1->4, 2->5, 3->7, 4->2, 5->1, 6->3, 7->6, and the background is important</p>
